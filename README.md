## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- **Linked List**: a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a linear order.
- **Stack**: a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Binary Tree**: a data structure that consists of nodes linked in a hierarchical structure.
- **Heap**: a data structure that is used to efficiently retrieve the maximum or minimum element from a set of elements.
- **Hash Table**: a data structure that is used to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
- **Graph**: a data structure that is used to model a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links.

Each data structure implementation includes a description, implementation details, and sample usage code in various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Search Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **String Algorithms**: String Matching, Longest Common Subsequence
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Knapsack Problem, Matrix Chain Multiplication

Each algorithm implementation includes a description, implementation details, and sample usage code in various programming languages.
